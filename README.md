# Mayan Clock
Mayan themed analog clock coded in Processing. Vectors made in Illustrator.

~Background~

For a creative coding project I had to create an interactive 'awkward' clock. I went for a Mayan calender / UFO infused theme. Functioning as a complete analog clock the user can read the time and set an alarm time. When the minute or hour changes (or the alarm state is triggered) parts will rotate and sections will light up.

~Installation~
- Download the project zip.
- Requires Processing: https://processing.org/
- Open the sketch via the "Mayan_Clock.pde".
- Run the sketch.

~Usage~
- Drag the two outer rings to change the target alarm time.
- Press the H key to view the documentation.
